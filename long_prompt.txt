In a world where technology has advanced beyond imagination, people now communicate through thought alone, eliminating the need for spoken language. However, a mysterious interference begins corrupting these thought transmissions, causing chaos, misunderstandings, and a breakdown of societal order. A group of unlikely heroes must uncover the origin of the interference, battling inner demons, rogue AI agents, and ancient encrypted secrets buried in the minds of the oldest citizens before civilization collapses entirely. (Case #1)
The Great Archive, a digital record of all human knowledge stored in a quantum server orbiting Earth, is suddenly locked down by an unknown force. Access to history, medicine, science, and even basic communication systems is denied. Panic spreads as the world realizes how dependent it has become on the Archive. A team of historians and hackers must decipher ancient analog records and navigate forgotten ruins to restore access before society reverts to a new dark age. (Case #2)
Beneath the icy crust of Europa, explorers discover an immense underwater labyrinth containing complex structures made of unknown metals. These structures pulse with rhythmic light and sound patterns resembling music. As scientists attempt to decode these alien symphonies, a series of strange phenomena begin occurring on Earth, hinting that humanity’s origins may not be terrestrial and that Europa’s melodies might be a message or a warning. (Case #3)
A genetic experiment meant to eliminate disease inadvertently unlocks telepathic abilities in a small percentage of the population. While some use their powers for peace and innovation, others manipulate and control with terrifying precision. Society fractures as distrust grows between the gifted and non-gifted. Amid the tension, a young empath discovers a deeper layer of consciousness connecting all minds, and must decide whether to unify or sever this psychic web forever. (Case #4)
Every 72 years, a city disappears without a trace, erased from memory and maps, as if it never existed. This time, a journalist receives a cryptic message that predicts the next vanishing. He races to document the city before it's lost, uncovering an ancient ritual linked to the movement of stars and a secret society trying to stop the cycle. But the closer he gets to the truth, the more his own memories begin to fade. (Case #5)
